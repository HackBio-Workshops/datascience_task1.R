# datascience_task1.R

Description: Now that I have learnt the basics of how to use R, its time to apply them to solve simple biological problems. Here, I have been given some random dataset, and I want to explore this dataset with an open mind. No strings attached!

About data set: Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts in reactive astrocytes promote vascular remodelling. Goebel et al. Comparison of FACS-enriched astrocytes from uninjured and injured wild-type mice at different time points

For ggplots, I used a new data set with link: https://github.com/HackBio-Internship/public_datasets/blob/main/R/datasets/aflatoxin_data
About data set: Growth and Toxigenicity of A. flavus on Resistant and Susceptible Peanut Genotypes. This study seeks to determine the reaction of peanut genotypes to  Aflatoxigenic and non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus inoculation and also determine the mechanisms of their resistance. It was established that non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus grows faster than aflatoxigenic A. flavus. There was no significant difference in the incidence and severity of the A. flavus resistant genotypes (L027B and ICGV-03401) however, there were significant differences between resistant genotypes and the susceptible check Manipinta.  This study also confirmed that non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus inoculation did not lead to aflatoxin production. Non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus identified could serve as  a good biocontrol against aflatoxin contamination under field conditions. Additionally, peanut genotypes with resistance to post-harvest aflatoxin accumulation will resist the growth of A. flavus and subsequent aflatoxin accumulation.
