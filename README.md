# datascience_task1.R

Description: Now that I have learnt the basics of how to use R, its time to apply them to solve simple biological problems. Here, I have been given some random dataset, and I want to explore this dataset with an open mind. No strings attached!

Data set link: https://github.com/HackBio-Internship/public_datasets/blob/main/R/datasets/astrocyte_data
About data set: Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts in reactive astrocytes promote vascular remodelling. Goebel et al. Comparison of FACS-enriched astrocytes from uninjured and injured wild-type mice at different time points

For ggplots, I used a new data set with link: https://github.com/HackBio-Internship/public_datasets/blob/main/R/datasets/fungal_data
About data set: Resources, key traits, and the size of fungal epidemics in Daphnia populations. Data on algal resources (log-transformed particulate carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus), Daphnia traits (size, reproduction, and parasite load), and epidemic size (integrated prevalence) calculated from weekly sampling of 12 lakes in Indiana, USA
